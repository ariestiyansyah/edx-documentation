.. _Use Swift for Data Storage:

####################################
Use Swift for Data Storage
####################################

To change the default configuration of an Open edX instance to use Swift (the
OpenStack Object Store project) for data storage, you update the
``/edx/app/edx_ansible/server-vars.yml`` file.

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 1

.. note:: Before proceeding, review :ref:`Guidelines for Updating the Open edX
  Platform`.

You can define all required and optional Swift settings at one time, or you can
update settings as needed over time. Each time you update the ``server-
vars.yml`` file, you must run the update command and restart the LMS server.

Before you change your data storage configuration, be sure to determine the
values that apply to your Swift data storage service, including your
credentials and the name of your container. Then, follow these steps.

.. _Define Required Swift Settings:

=========================================
Define Required Swift Settings
=========================================

#. Stop the LMS server.

#. Create or edit the ``/edx/app/edx_ansible/server-vars.yml`` file.

   Be sure to replace any example values for the settings that follow with
   values that apply to your instance.

#. Define or verify the following settings.

   .. code-block:: yaml

     EDXAPP_SETTINGS: "openstack"
     VHOST_NAME: "openstack"

#. To configure Swift, define values for each of the following settings. The
   ``EDXAPP_SWIFT_AUTH_VERSION`` can be set to either ``1`` or ``2``, and
   defaults to ``1`` if not specified.

   .. code-block:: yaml

     EDXAPP_SWIFT_USERNAME: ""
     EDXAPP_SWIFT_KEY: ""
     EDXAPP_SWIFT_TENANT_ID: ""
     EDXAPP_SWIFT_TENANT_NAME: ""
     EDXAPP_SWIFT_AUTH_URL: ""
     EDXAPP_SWIFT_AUTH_VERSION:
     EDXAPP_SWIFT_REGION_NAME: ""

#. Customize the name of the Swift container that your system's files will be
   uploaded to by defining the following setting.

   .. code-block:: yaml

      EDXAPP_FILE_UPLOAD_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME: "container_name"

#. To configure storage for grade reports, define the following settings. The
   ``name_prefix`` that you define specifies a common prefix for the files
   generated by the system.

   .. code-block:: yaml

     COMMON_OBJECT_STORE_LOG_SYNC: true
     .
     .
     .
     EDXAPP_GRADE_STORAGE_CLASS: 'swift.storage.SwiftStorage'
     EDXAPP_GRADE_STORAGE_KWARGS:
       name_prefix: "grades/"
     .
     .
     .
     ENABLE_GRADE_DOWNLOADS: true

   You can continue on to define Swift settings for other features, or complete
   the following steps to update your instance.

#. Run the ``/edx/bin/update`` command.

   ::

      sudo /edx/bin/update edx-platform <your-branch-name>

.. #. Run the openstack role (? question to Feanil about the best way to do this)

#. Restart the LMS server.

#. Repeat this procedure for each instance that has data that you want to store
   on Swift.

============================================================
Define Swift Settings for Identity Verification (Proctoring)
============================================================

To define data storage for files that verify learner identity, follow these
steps.

#. Stop the LMS server.

#. Edit the ``/edx/app/edx_ansible/server-vars.yml`` file.

#. Verify that you have defined all of the :ref:`required Swift settings<Define
   Required Swift Settings>`.

#. Define the following settings.

   Be sure to replace any example values for the settings that follow with
   values that apply to your instance.

   .. code-block:: yaml

     EDXAPP_VERIFY_STUDENT:
       DAYS_GOOD_FOR: 365
       SOFTWARE_SECURE:
         STORAGE_CLASS: "swift.storage.SwiftStorage"
         STORAGE_KWARGS:
           name_prefix: "photos/"

#. Continue on to define Swift settings for other features, or complete steps
   7-10 for :ref:`defining required Swift settings<Define Required Swift
   Settings>` to update your instance.

==========================================
Define Swift Settings for Temporary URLs
==========================================

To use temporary URLs for Swift, follow these steps.

#. Stop the LMS server.

#. Edit the ``/edx/app/edx_ansible/server-vars.yml`` file.

#. Verify that you have defined all of the :ref:`required Swift settings<Define
   Required Swift Settings>`.

#. Define the following settings.

   The duration setting is the value, in seconds, for how long a temporary URL
   remains valid.

   .. code-block:: yaml

     SWIFT_USE_TEMP_URLS: true
     SWIFT_TEMP_URL_KEY: ""
     SWIFT_TEMP_URL_DURATION:

#. Continue on to define Swift settings for other features, or complete steps
   7-10 for :ref:`defining required Swift settings<Define Required Swift
   Settings>` to update your instance.

==========================================
Define Swift Settings for XQueue
==========================================

To define data storage for files for external graders, follow these
steps.

#. Stop the LMS server.

#. Edit the ``/edx/app/edx_ansible/server-vars.yml`` file.

#. Verify that you have defined all of the :ref:`required Swift settings<Define
   Required Swift Settings>`.

#. Define the following settings.

   In a basic setup, the values for these variables are the same as for the
   ``EDXAPP_SWIFT_*`` settings.

   .. code-block:: yaml

     XQUEUE_SETTINGS: "openstack_settings"
     XQUEUE_SWIFT_USERNAME: ""
     XQUEUE_SWIFT_KEY: ""
     XQUEUE_SWIFT_TENANT_ID: ""
